# Portfolio-v1.2

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Portfolio-v1.2** is a high-performance personal portfolio website designed to showcase my professional background, skills, and projects. It is built using a modern static-site architecture to ensure speed, SEO optimization, and a seamless user experience across all devices.

## 🛠️ Built With

This project leverages the following technologies:

* **[Astro](https://astro.build/):** The core static site generator used for its island architecture and zero-JS-by-default approach.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid, responsive styling.
* **[React](https://react.dev/):** Used for interactive UI components (e.g., `HeroSection.tsx`, `NavigationBar.tsx`).
* **TypeScript:** For type-safe code and better development tooling.
